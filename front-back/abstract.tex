\begin{abstract}
As learning JavaScript is not easy, educating this skill is often difficult and
time consuming. The Open University offers a course which educates in writing 
JavaScript code. Tutors of this course emerged a demand from students, for 
receiving proper feedback on the actual JavaScript-code they had written. 
As manual examination is too labour intensive, a search for alternatives began.
This search has led to this project, which aims at reducing the workload for 
tutors at the one hand, while maintaining or even improving the quality of the 
course.

This thesis mainly describes the result of the Javascript-Examiner project, 
which aims at creating a tool that is able to automatically provide feedback on
particular Javascript code.
