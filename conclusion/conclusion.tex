\chapter{Conclusion}

At the beginning we thought our "mission" was to design a tool for examining \gls{js-code} and to
possibly create a prototype.
But along the way, it became appereant that the product owner had a full working
system in mind, which could be used in
the next following session of the \gls{wac} course.
Eventually, we have succeeded to deliver a fully operational system.


\section{Recommendation}

Throughout the document we have given various recommendations of future work
that can be done by following teams.
