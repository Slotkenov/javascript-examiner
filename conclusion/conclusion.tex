\chapter{Conclusion}

At the beginning our goal of the project and the expectations of the product
owner were not the same.
We thought our mission was to design a tool for examining \gls{js-code} and to
possibly create a prototype.
The product owner had a full working system in mind, which could be used in
the next following session of the \gls{wac} course.
Eventually, we have succeeded to deliver a fully operational system.

At the end of the project we can make a conclusion about the things that went
well and things that didn't went well.

Things that went well :

- working together as a team
- production of a working system

Things that didn't went well :
- using the web server supplied by the OU.
