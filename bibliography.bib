Using this tutor, students receive feedback about whether or not they are on the right track, can ask for a hint when they are stuck, and get suggestions about how to refactor their program. Our tutor generates this semantically rich feedback from model solutions, using advanced concepts from software technology. We show how a teacher can add an exercise to the tutor, and fine-tune feedback. We report on an experiment in which we used our tutor.},

  abstract = {This article examines the distinct differences between ‘distance education’ and ‘e-learning’ in higher education settings. Since the emergence of the new information and communication technologies (ICT), many have related to them as the new generation of distance education, and some have referred to their implementation in academia as challenging the very existence of campus-based universities. Many policy makers, scholars and practitioners in higher education use these two terms interchangeably as synonyms. But the fact is that distance education in most higher education systems is not delivered through the new electronic media, and vice versa – e-learning in most universities and colleges all over the world is not used for distance education purposes. ‘Distance education’ and ‘e-learning’ do overlap in some cases, but are by no means identical. The lack of distinction between ‘e-learning’ and ‘distance education’ accounts for much of the misunderstanding of the ICT roles in higher education, and for the wide gap between the rhetoric in the literature describing the future sweeping effects of the ICT on educational environments and their actual implementation. The article examines the erroneous assumptions on which many exaggerated predictions as to the future impact of the ICT were based upon, and it concludes with highlighting the future trends of ‘distance education’ and ‘e-learning’ in academia.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the feedback features of a distance learning teacher training course in second/foreign language learning (Greek). The course attempted to offer a balanced syllabus on the theory of second/foreign language learning and practical information for language teachers to adopt and implement in the language classroom. The course embodied 10 units incorporated into five modules, namely: (i) methodology of teaching; (ii) teaching of listening; (iii) teaching of writing; (iv) teaching of spelling; and (v) testing. Each module was designed to take approximately –4 hr for students to complete. All the material was stored on the Internet and participants were provided with user names and passwords to access it from their location. Instructions on how to run the software and useful tips relating to distance self-study were also provided on-line. Where possible, the material was written in a conversational style in order to activate the participants' knowledge of the subject. From a total of 51 applications, 33 applicants were selected, and 21 actually started the course. All participants had to submit a compulsory assignment for every module (every 15 days) and two final projects (of their choice from a total of five topics), after having completed the five modules. Drop-out rates were very low; 18 students finished the course successfully and completed a questionnaire related to technical, design, relevance, and feedback issues. The results revealed several interesting issues related to design, application and feedback, resulting from the way in which each student exploited the material for self-study.},

This tightening of the traditional edit-compile-run cycle reduces the cognitive gap between program code and execution, improving the learning experience of beginning programmers while boosting the productivity of seasoned ones. Unfortunately, live programming is difficult to realize in practice as imperative languages lack well-defined abstraction boundaries that make live programming responsive or its feedback comprehensible. This paper enables live programming for user interface programming by cleanly separating the rendering and non-rendering aspects of a UI program, allowing the display to be refreshed on a code change without restarting the program. A type and effect system formalizes this separation and provides an evaluation model that incorporates the code update step. By putting live programming on a more formal footing, we hope to enable critical and technical discussion of live programming systems.},

We are building an online tool that will help students who already know Python learn the syntax and semantics of Java. Our system will differ from existing online tutors and tools for learning Java in two main aspects. First, our tutor will focus on the transition from Python to Java. Using this basis will allow us to gloss over basic concepts of programming which students are already familiar with and focus on the specifics of Java. Second, our tutor will crowdsource writing test cases for problems to the learners themselves. This will give students practice writing tests, and will also reduce the burden on instructors, who would otherwise need to implement test suites for every problem in the tutor.},

The mapping between game content construction actions and actual source code forms an implicit example-based learning environment, allowing programming concepts to be more clearly conveyed than in conventional integrated development environment (IDE) or static lecture materials. An experimental evaluation of a prototype system suggests the potential of this approach for programming education by scoring highly in terms of both user satisfaction and potential pedagogical capability.},

With such a strategy, we can automatically generate worked-out solutions, track the progress of a student by inspecting submitted intermediate answers, and report back suggestions in case the student deviates from the strategy. Because we can calculate all kinds of feedback automatically from a strategy specification, it becomes less labor-intensive and less ad-hoc to specify new exercise domains and exercises within that domain.

A strategy describes valid sequences of transformation rules that solve the exercise at hand, which turns tracking intermediate steps into a parsing problem. This is a promising view at the problem because it allows us to take advantage of many years of experience in parsing sentences of context-free languages, and transfer this knowledge and technology to the domain of stepwise solving exercises.

In this paper we work out the similarities between parsing and solving exercises incrementally, and we discuss the implementation of a recognizer for strategies. We present a full implementation of such a recognizer, and discuss a number of design choices we have made. In particular, we discuss the use of a fixed point combinator to deal with repetition, and labels to mark positions in the strategy.},

However, most of the introductory curricula provide no introduction to test design, no support for defining the tests, and do not insist on a comprehensive test coverage that is the driving force of the TDD. This paper presents a curriculum, pedagogy, and the software support for introductory object-oriented program design that uses the TDD consistently from the very beginning. The testing software does not increase the program complexity and is designed to work with the simplest programs. It has been used by hundreds of students at several colleges and is freely available on the web. Our experiences show that besides improving the quality of code students produce, TDD combined with the novice-appropriate test libraries reinforces students' understanding of the object oriented program design.},

This is a report on the first-year programming course taught at Tübingen and Freiburg universities. The course builds on the well-developed systematic approaches using functional programming, pioneered by the PLT group. In recent years, we have introduced novel approaches to the teaching process itself. In particular, assisted programming sessions gave the students a solid basis for developing their programming skills. In this paper we trace the development of our approach. Furthermore, we have collected information on how well our course had worked, and how the results together with our experience gained over years have lead to substantial, measurable improvements.},

TDL offers the potential of teaching testing for free, of improving programmer comprehension and ability, and of improving software quality both in terms of design quality and reduced defect density.This paper introduces test-driven learning as a pedagogical tool. It will provide examples of how TDL can be incorporated at multiple levels in computer science and software engineering curriculum for beginning through professional programmers. In addition, the relationships between TDL and test-driven development will be explored.Initial evidence indicates that TDL can improve student comprehension of new concepts while improving their testing skills with no additional instruction time. In addition, by learning to construct programs in a test-driven manner, students are expected to be more likely to develop their own code with a test-driven approach, likely resulting in improved software designs and quality.},

	abstract = {Despite our best efforts and intentions as educators, student programmers continue to struggle in acquiring comprehension and analysis skills. Students believe that once a program runs on sample data, it is correct; most programming errors are reported by the compiler; when a program misbehaves, shuffling statements and tweaking expressions to see what happens is the best debugging approach. This paper presents a new vision for computer science education centered around the use of test-driven development in all programming assignments, from the beginning of CS1. A key element to the strategy is comprehensive, automated evaluation of student work, in terms of correctness, the thoroughness and validity of the student's tests, and an automatic coding style assessment performed using industrial-strength tools. By systematically applying the strategy across the curriculum as part of a student's regular programming activities, and by providing rapid, concrete, useful feedback that students find valuable, it is possible to induce a cultural shift in how students behave.},

	abstract = {Coercing new programmers to adopt disciplined development practices such as thorough unit testing is a challenging endeavor. Test-driven development (TDD) has been proposed as a solution to improve both software design and testing. Test-driven learning (TDL) has been proposed as a pedagogical approach for teaching TDD without imposing significant additional instruction time. This research evaluates the effects of students using a test-first (TDD) versus test-last approach in early programming courses, and considers the use of TDL on a limited basis in CS1 and CS2. Software testing, programmer productivity, programmer performance, and programmer opinions are compared between test-first and test-last programming groups. Results from this research indicate that a test-first approach can increase student testing and programmer performance, but that early programmers are very reluctant to adopt a test-first approach, even after having positive experiences using TDD. Further, this research demonstrates that TDL can be applied in CS1/2, but suggests that a more pervasive implementation of TDL may be necessary to motivate and establish disciplined testing practice among early programmers.},
