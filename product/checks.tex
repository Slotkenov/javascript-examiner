\section{Format}

The format of the JavaScript within the solution is checked with the standard
JavaScript Code Style (JSCS) code style checker.
It's configuration can be set through a configuration file, jscs-config.json.
Currently the content of this file is {"preset": "google"} which set the checker

\section{Functionality}

The functionality check is a check which 
var fs = require('fs');
var database = require('../database');
var crypto = require('crypto');
var Mocha = require('mocha');
var reporter = Mocha.reporters.JSON;






\section{Maintainability}
var esprima = require('esprima');
var escomplex = require('escomplex');
var walker = require('escomplex-ast-moz');
This check returns an Abstract Syntax Tree if that can be produced.


\section{Syntax}
var esprima = require('esprima');
var UglifyJS = require('uglify-js');

//configuration for esprima parsing are included in the check-syntax.js file.
