% This chapter should discuss the global architecture of the whole app.

\section{Architecture}
We will be laying the groundwork for this project
with just a few of the functionalities it requires.
Other teams will pick up where we left and complement this software project.
Because of this we chose to use a service oriented approach.
Each functional requirement for examining \gls{js-code}
will be encapsulated in a service.
The backend \gls{source-code} has the ability to use these services.
It can call them in any order, use their responses
and supply responses from one service to another.
The frontend \gls{source-code} displays the user interface to the end user
and contacts the backend for sending and receiving the necessary information.
Persistence of data is managed through some kind of database system
containing the domain.
The backend has access to this domain.

For any future development of this project
the domain can be expanded
and services can be added
without the need to make complex changed to the existing code base.
Only the backend \gls{source-code} needs change
to make use of the added domain data and services.
